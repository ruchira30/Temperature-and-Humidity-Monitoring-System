Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System

Overview

This project features a temperature and humidity monitoring system built using a Raspberry Pi, a DHT22 sensor, and an LCD screen. The system captures environmental data and displays it in real-time, providing a practical example of interfacing sensors with a microcontroller.

Features

- Temperature and humidity monitoring with real-time data display.
- Integration of DHT22 sensor with Raspberry Pi using GPIO-based communication.
- Data visualization on an LCD screen through parallel communication.
- Python programming on Raspberry Pi for data acquisition and display.

Hardware Components

- Raspberry Pi: Acts as the central processing unit for data handling and communication.
- DHT22 Sensor: Measures temperature and humidity levels.
- LCD Screen: Displays temperature and humidity readings in real-time.

Software

The system is programmed in Python using the Thonny IDE. The code includes:

- Sensor Data Acquisition: Reads temperature and humidity data from the DHT22 sensor.
- Data Display: Sends sensor data to the LCD screen using parallel communication to display
